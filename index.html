									<h2>Introduction
									</a></h2>
									<p style="text-align:justify;">Hello and nice to meet you! Pleasure to have you on my resume website. I am a fourth year
									International Business -student based in Tampere. After graduation in December of 2021,
									my plan is to find a job in the field of finance. On this first tab, you can learn more about my
									work experience. There are also two other tabs, dedicated for my education and other qualifications.
